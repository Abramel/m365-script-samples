# Report of Private Teams to Excel

## Summary

This sample gathers all of the teams private channels in your tenant and produces an Excel file which is then uploaded to a SharePoint Site.
Two connections are used, one for the Admin Centre and the other to upload the file to the "Documents" location in the root site.
