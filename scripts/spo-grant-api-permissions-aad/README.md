# Grant API permissions to SharePoint Azure AD Application

## Summary

When developing your SPFx components, you usually first run them locally before deploying them (really ?).

And then comes the time to work with API such as Microsoft Graph.

If you never use those permissions before in your SPFx projects (and the tenant with which you're working), you realize that you have to:
 
Add required API permissions in your "package-solution.json" file

 * Bundle / Ship your project
 * Publish it
 * Go to the SharePoint Admin Center Web API Permissions page
 * Approve those permissions

All of this, just to play with the API as you didn't plan to release your package in a production environment.

So what if you could bypass all these steps for both Graph and owned API?
 
> [!important}
> This trick is just for development purposes. In Production environment, you should update your "package.json" file to add required permissions and allow them (or ask for validation) in the 
*API Access*  page.

> [!warning]
> These permissions will be granted on the whole tenant and could be used by any script running in your tenant. More info [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/use-aadhttpclient#considerations).
